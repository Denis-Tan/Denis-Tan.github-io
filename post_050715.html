                    <p>Singapore’s golden jubilee is a tremendous milestone in the history of our small island nation.</p>
					
					<p>Small nations, like speedboats in an ocean populated by giant tankers and mid-sized barges, have their navigational freedom inevitably curtailed by the nautical discretion of much larger vessels. Beyond foreign policy, small nations’ internal norms face continual inundation by waves of social and cultural mores of larger ships. Today’s highly networked world exacerbates that process by compressing the navigational space, bringing vessels in the global informational ocean ever closer.</p>

                    <p>What, then, will the composition, values, and attitudes of the Singaporean speedboat look like in another half century? I offer three observations, primarily drawn from a recent <a href="http://www.apa.sg/index.php/sg100/dream-future">forum</a>.</p>

                    <h2 class="section-heading">The values of society will shift, but not by much</h2>

                    <p>Prior to the forum, a list of agreed values and aspirations for 2065 were drawn up by youth leaders from local junior colleges, polytechnics, and universities. The agreed set of values were <b>brotherhood</b> (encompassing traits of both common identify and a shared sense of belonging to Singapore), <b>equality</b> (of treatment), <b>progress</b> (both economic and societal), <b>preparedness</b> (to traditional and emergent threats), <b>equity</b> (of opportunity), and <b>sensitivity</b> (to both the rights of minorities and the fact of religious diversity).</p>

                    <p>When Dr Toh Chin Chye, then deputy prime minister of Singapore, led a committee to <a href="http://eresources.nlb.gov.sg/infopedia/articles/SIP_488_2004-12-18.html?utm_expid=85360850-6.qNOOYF40RhKK6gXsQEaAJA.0">design Singapore’s national flag</a>, the shared ideals of our founding fathers were imprinted in every aspect of the flag. Those ideals were universal brotherhood, everlasting purity & virtue, democracy, peace, progress, justice, and equality.</p>

                    <p>Most values remain unchanging as we pass our nation from one generation to the next. Some ideals are no longer aspirational - <a href="https://www.cpib.gov.sg/international/international-and-regional-corruption-related-surveys-rankings/transparency">purity & virtue</a>, <a href="https://sg.news.yahoo.com/singapore-ranks-24th-in-global-peace-index--4th-in-apac-rankings-062326212.html">peace</a>, and <a href="http://www.singaporelawwatch.sg/slw/headlinesnews/64318-singapore-ranks-9th-for-rule-of-law.html">justice</a> - have arguably been achieved with much aplomb though much care must be taken to reject complacency and continue our enduring pursuit of ever greater excellence. Democracy, despite naysayers categorising us as an <a href="http://www.jstor.org/stable/3993422">illiberal</a> one, is also a value no-longer aspired to by our youths, perhaps because of gradual but perceptible <a href="http://www.todayonline.com/commentary/evolution-modern-singapores-civil-society">trimming of our banyan tree</a>. </p>
					
					<p>Preparedness, equity, and sensitivity have taken their places. These seem to be symptomatic of pragmatic recognition by our youths of the emerging threats of terrorism, yawning inequality, and social undercurrents with the emergence of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/LGBT">LGBT</a> issues.</p>

                    <h2 class="section-heading">The Wave of Progressiveness if Inevitable</h2>

                    <p>Two interesting straw polls were taken at forum. First, an overwhelming majority of youth leaders wanted acceptance of alternative family structures, with more than half of these wanted full and equal recognition of such structures. This was a stark contrast to a recent poll by the Institute of Policy Studies in 2013 where only <a href="http://www.todayonline.com/singapore/liberal-attitudes-gay-lifestyles-not-prevalent-here">26% accepted homosexual behaviour</a>. 

					<p>Second, another overwhelming majority of youth leaders saw Singapore as “conservative” today. This is contrasted with the more evenly distributed outcome of another straw poll that was taken at a forum with working adults. The perception of conservativeness is clearly shaped by different definitions between the two groups. Whatever we have today, the youths clearly think that it is not sufficiently progressive.
</p>

                   <h2 class="section-heading">Asian Values Remain Apt</h2>
				   
                    <p>Despite aspiring to greater openness and progressiveness, sensitivity to the circumstances of minority groups, religious, racial, sexual, or otherwise, remains strong. This consistent theme reflects the strong preference for social harmony and collective well-being, concepts embodied by the idea of <b>Asian Values</b>.</p>

                    <p>Much criticism has been levelled on this idea due to the <a href="http://www.nyu.edu/classes/gmoran/SEN.pdf">diversity of Asia</a> and the many <a href="https://www.foreignaffairs.com/articles/southeast-asia/1994-11-01/culture-destiny-myth-asias-anti-democratic-values">success stories found in democratic Asian societies</a>. Whatever youth predisposition, the willingness of youths - who are much more vocal and liberal than any other demographic group - to curtail their own “freedoms” in recognition of Singapore’s circumstance is food for thought.</p>
					
					<p>The Asian century with Asian values may very well materialise. Singapore in 2065 will have evolved much, but many of our - and our founding fathers' - values will endure.</p>
