                <div class="col-lg-8 col-lg-offset-2 col-md-10 col-md-offset-1">
                    <p>Some 26 months back, I joined a highly motivated and mission-driven team for my first posting in public service. It would prove to be an experience to treasure. I look back now with an uncontrollable grin. I wouldn't have chosen any differently, having learnt an immense amount during this short stint.</p>
					
					<p>Joining the service was an obligation - both in the literal and metaphorical sense. Literal since I was bonded. Metaphorical because I wanted to play a part (big or small it was no matter) in making my country better. I truly believed in this (so let me encourage that you eschew cynicism no matter how world-wary you have become). And i still do.</p>

                    <p>The best fit back in 2015 was a role in environmental sustainability. I had just graduated with a Master of Public Administration in environmental policy from Columbia University. It was therefore a toss-up between two organisations. The decision came more easily than I expected. It was decisively sealed after an interview with my former boss.</p>

                    <p>So I joined, after a curiously long wait for my security clearance to pass (was it something I did?), on 31 Jul 2015. From day 1, the team made me feel just at home. The boss was just as I've come to expect - fantastic. He gave me the space and opportunity to grow. And grow I did.</p>

                    <p>Now, I leave with fond memories in tow. My colleagues have also taught me plenty. I'm now wiser, yet not one bit more cynical. Indeed, the first job is always something special. But now it is time to move on to learn more, do more, and contribute more. I shall leave you with my 3 takeaways:</p>

                    <h2 class="section-heading">Have an Independent Mind, Learn Only the Good Things</h2>

                    <p>Everyone brings along different experiences (read: good), influences (read: sometimes good) and biases (read: bad). The onus lies on the individual to tell apart what is good to retain vis-a-vis what "seems" good to retain.</p>

                    <h2 class="section-heading">People Matter, Be Kind</h2>

                    <p>It is not always in vogue to be kind. But I will always try to be kind. To colleagues, to bosses, to counterparts, heck, even to "adversaries". I may fail - I am human afterall and stress can get to me. But one can disagree without being disagreeable. The service is afterall meant to work as a collective whole to improve the country, not disparate fiefdoms to satisfy individual vanity. If one is kind by default, rapport can come quite easily. The responsibility to maintain this invisible grease that helps the service tick falls on each and every one.</p>

                    <h2 class="section-heading">Speak Truth to Power</h2>

                    <p>The system ticks because people do their jobs. The job description can actually be summarised quite easily - it is to create as conducive an environment as possible so that right decisions can be made. What is right is of course up for debate. But creating a conductive environment, to me, is abundantly clear that it includes flagging the bad stuff and not just the good. It is all too easy to stay silent. But if a bad call ends up being made because of the silence, then it would be ridiculous to absolve ourselves by thinking we hold no responsibility.</p>
